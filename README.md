# Galactic Empire

This project is an open-source recreation/extension of a classic Mac shareware game (also called Galactic Empire) by Cary Torkelson.  See _Playing the Original_ below for more information on that.

# Playing the Game

This is a project for [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro).  You can try it out with these steps:

1. Download [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro), if you don't have it already.  The first time you launch it, you may need to right-click and tell your OS to calm down (as the application is not currently code-signed).

2. Clone or download this repo to your local hard drive.

3. In Mini Micro, mount the folder containing this README and the various .ms (MiniScript) files.

4. At the Mini Micro prompt, type:
```
load "main"
run
```


# Playing the Original

You can play the original Cary Torkelson game online using a Mac emulator, but it requires a bit of setup:

1. Download a copy of the game from someplace like [this](https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=14561).

2. Fire up an emulated MacOS 8.1 machine, for example [here](https://infinitemac.org/1998/Mac%20OS%208.1).

3. Drag your Galactic Empire file onto the emulator.  Once uploaded, you should find it in the "The Outside World:Uploads" folder on the emulated Mac.

4. Unpack, double-click, and enjoy.
