# Galactic Conquest


# Playing the Original

You can play the original Cary Torkelson game online using a Mac emulator, but it requires a bit of setup:

1. Download a copy of the game from someplace like [this](https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=14561).

2. Fire up an emulated MacOS 8.1 machine, for example [here](https://infinitemac.org/1998/Mac%20OS%208.1).

3. Drag your Galactic Empire file onto the emulator.  Once uploaded, you should find it in the "The Outside World:Uploads" folder on the emulated Mac.

4. Unpack, double-click, and enjoy.
